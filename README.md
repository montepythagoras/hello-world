Hi Humans!

I got my Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics.  The motivation was primarily to better understand the nature and extent of universal behaviour observed in the scaling of finite condensed matter systems undergoing first and second order phase transitions in the hyperscaling regime, embedded in d-dimensional space, split into distinct dimensional euclidean spaces, a finite system of characteristic length L under geometric constraints and subject to some boundary condition in thermal equilibrium with a bulk d'-dimensional (infinite) one:  

    L^(d - d') x {\infinity}^d', {2 < d' < d < 4}  
    
Most realistic models were not analytically tractable and the bulk of researchers were trending down the numerical (Monte Carlo) simulation route to find answers.  While a very powerful tool with increasing computational power, this route tended to muddy the waters as to the theoretical justification for the observed universality of disparate systems near their critical point (e.g. temperature, pressure).  My Ph.D. was almost entirely analytic, with one rudimentary numerical zero finding program in Fortran77.
