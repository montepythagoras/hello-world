Hi Humans!

I got my Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics.  The motivation was primarily to better understand the nature and extent of universal apparent behaviour observed in the scaling of finite condensed matter systems undergoing first and second order phase transitions in the hyperscaling regime embedded in d-dimensional space various geometric constraints parameterised in d'-dimensions:  

    L^(d - d') x {\infinity}^d', {2 < d' < d < 4}  
    
Most realistic models were not analytically tractable and the bulk researchers were trending down the numerical (Monte Carlo) simulation route.  My Ph.D. was almost entirely analytic, with rudimentary numerical work on in Fortran77.
